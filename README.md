## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.0 or higher
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Git**: Latest version
- **Android Studio/VS Code**: For development
- **Python Package Manager**: pip

### üì± Frontend Setup (Flutter Application)

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tantawi65/Healthcare.git
   cd Healthcare
   ```

2. **Install Flutter Dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Flutter Environment**

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

   Ensure all requirements are met before proceeding.

4. **Run the Flutter Application**

   ```bash
   # For Android
   flutter run

   # For iOS (macOS only)
   flutter run -d ios

   # For Web
   flutter run -d web
   ```

### üêç Backend Services Setup

The application consists of three separate FastAPI backend services that need to be started individually.

#### 1. Symptom Checker Service (Port 8002)

```bash
# Navigate to the service directory
cd backend/Text_classification/symptom_checker

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload
```

#### 2. Image Classification Service (Port 8000)

```bash
# Navigate to the service directory
cd backend/Image_classification

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

#### 3. Lab Analysis Service (Port 8003)

```bash
# Navigate to the service directory
cd backend/Lab_analysis

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file and add your Hugging Face API key:
# HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8003 --reload
```

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in each backend service directory with the following variables:

```env
# Hugging Face API Key for Lab Analysis
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-huggingface-api-key-here

# API Configuration
SYMPTOM_CHECKER_PORT=8002
IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION_PORT=8000
LAB_ANALYSIS_PORT=8003

# CORS Origins (for production)
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com
```

### Flutter API Configuration

Update the API endpoints in `lib/services/api_service.dart` if needed:

```dart
class ApiService {
  static const String symptomCheckerBaseUrl = 'http://localhost:8002';
  static const String imageClassificationBaseUrl = 'http://localhost:8000';
  static const String labAnalysisBaseUrl = 'http://localhost:8003';
}
```

### Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Test Symptom Checker
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/api/check-symptoms" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"symptoms": ["fever", "cough", "headache"]}'

# Test Image Classification
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/classify-image" \
     -F "image=@/path/to/medical/image.jpg"

# Test Lab Analysis
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/api/analyze-lab" \

```

### Backend Deployment

For production deployment, consider using:

- **Docker containers** for each service
- **Environment variable management**
- **Load balancing** for high availability
- **API rate limiting** and authentication
- **Database integration** for user data persistence

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Model Files**: AI model files are excluded from the repository due to size constraints. You'll need to train your own models or obtain pre-trained models separately.
- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
- **Security**: This application is for educational and research purposes. Implement proper authentication and security measures for production use.
